# neural-network-analysis-for-cardiac-arrythmias-dataset

Used C programming language and MATLAB platform

The significance of this project and research is to analyze and make a comparison in which type of Neural Network algorithm and model will be more accurate to make a further prediction using cardiac arrhythmias dataset. In further, the success of this project will make it easier for medical professionals to detect the disease in early phases to save more lives.

In this project, the objectives will be mentioned below: -
1. To solve the imbalance data problem
2. To reduce the dimensionality of the data
3. To analyse which type of neural network model will produce an accurate result with cardiac arrythmias dataset [Feed Forward Neural Network,Recurrent Neural Network,Recurrent Neural Network,Generalized Regression Neural Network algorithms]


In this section, there is a source of coding to perform the Neural Network algorithm. In the MATLAB, function such as patternet, layrecnet, cascadeforwardnet and newgrnn has been implemented to produce the accuracy of each algorithm.
